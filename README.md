## Description

This is my third challenge assignment for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. This application uses JavaScript to generate a unique password based on user-selected criteria. Users can choose if they want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerical characters, or special characters. They must choose at least one character type to include. Users can then also specify the length of the password generated, but the number of characters must be between 8 and 128.

## Deployed Site

## Features

Once the user clicks the "generate password" button, they will be directed through a series of window alert prompts which will ask them which password specifications they would like to include. Once the prompts have been completed, a randomized password will be dynamically created and added to the page.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Development

In the future, I would like to add the following improvements:

- Clicking "cancel" on the window prompt will cancel the password generator at any time and return the user to the main page.
- A separate button labeled "copy" will dynamically appear next to the existing "generate password" button once a password has been generated. If the user clicks this button, the password will automatically be copied to their clipboard.
- The user will have the option to customize which special characters they would like to include their password generation.

I'm always interested in refactoring code to improve it's functionality. If you would like to suggest your own improvements, you can reach our development team at the links below.
